								<p class="content">Along with my experience in technology sales, I have been molding my career to obtain extensive knowlege with how data is transferred and integrated. I troubleshoot and test software to make sure data is accurate and accessible. In my first role as a Systems Administrator, I supported the sales department by implementing software to produce data at the click of a button, so the sales department could pull data for proposals in a clear and quick manner. That first year, our revenue grew over 2 million and I cut down proposal work by 66%. I am currently in a cohort learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.JS, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. I have worked with data using SQL queries and I also build and maintain our deaprtments website with WordPress. </p>
